    How to use Antilapse:
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>To add an event: </strong>Enter a date and time using the menu, and press "Set Coundown". The list will automatically sort 
    based on the nearest date. 
    <br>
    <strong>To delete an event: </strong>Enter the label of the event you wish to get rid of, and press "Remove Countdown". 
    <br><br>
    Antilapse will send you notifications whenever your countdowns reach 1 day, and then 1 hour. Text will change color based on urgency.
    <br>
    It will also generate a quote each time you open the window to remind you that time is relentless, and only you have the power to act before it arrives. 
</p>
<h3>
    Development:
</h3>
<p>
    Antilapse serves as my first ever project, and is one of my first steps in 
    the important process of building my resume. 
    <br><br>
    Regarding the roadmap; this project is mostly complete. I may experiment with adding the D2L API to automate adding dates for students, 
    or creating a small settings tab as well.
